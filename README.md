# Obligation-Risk-AI
AI-Powered Risk & Obligation Tracking System
This project was initially developed for the NASSCOM AI Submission 2024 and demonstrates how risks and obligations can be extracted and tracked using AI-driven analysis from various types of documents.

Although originally created for NASSCOM, the project will continue to evolve with further enhancements to improve its capabilities and completeness.

Key Features:
1.Clause Extraction – Identifies and extracts relevant clauses from documents.\n
2.Term Extraction – Extracts key terms for better understanding and classification. \n
3.Risk Identification – Detects potential risks present in the document. \n
4.Obligation Extraction – Extracts and categorizes obligations automatically. \n
5.Task Conversion – Converts obligations into actionable tasks. \n
6.Milestone Generation – Transforms obligations into structured project milestones. \n
This project aims to streamline risk and compliance tracking using AI, making it a valuable tool for document analysis and contract management. \n
